# Machine Learning Tutorials
Each folder in this repository contains a stand alone machine learning tutorial, which I originally wrote for Decoding Biology, on topics ranging from data preperation, evaluation metrics, algorithm spot-checking, hyperparameter tuning, and more. I will continue updating this repository with additional tutorials over time.

- [Evaluation Metrics For Classification Problems](https://github.com/evanpeikon/machine-learning/tree/main/Classification-Metrics)
